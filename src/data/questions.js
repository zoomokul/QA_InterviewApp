    },
    {
      question: 'What are the restrictions on using variables in Lambda Expressions?',
      answer: 'Variables used in Lambda Expressions must be effectively final or effectively effectively final (i.e., not modified after being captured by the Lambda Expression). They can capture, but not modify, local variables.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What is the role of the `::` operator in Method References?',
      answer: "The `::` operator in Method References is used to refer to methods by their names. It separates the method's qualifying class or object from the method name, allowing you to create references to methods.",
    },
    {
      question: 'What is the purpose of the `Function` functional interface in Java?',
      answer: 'The `Function` functional interface in Java represents a function that takes one input and produces one output. It is commonly used for mapping operations in Java Streams.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How do you enable parallel processing using Java Streams?',
      answer: 'Parallel processing can be enabled in Java Streams by invoking the `parallel()` method on a stream. This allows operations to be performed concurrently on multiple threads for improved performance.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What is the difference between the `filter` and `map` operations in Java Streams?',
      answer: 'The `filter` operation is used to select elements that meet a specified condition, while the `map` operation transforms each element in a stream into a new element using a given function.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What are the common use cases for using Java Lambda Expressions?',
      answer: 'Common use cases for using Java Lambda Expressions include filtering and transforming data in collections, implementing callbacks, simplifying code, and enabling functional programming constructs.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What is the syntax for a multi-line Lambda Expression in Java?',
      answer: 'A multi-line Lambda Expression in Java is enclosed in curly braces `{}` and can contain multiple statements. For example: `(parameter) -> { statement1; statement2; }`',
    },
